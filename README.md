Student Enrollment Form - JsonPowerDB Integration
Description
The Student Enrollment Form project allows users to input, save, and update student data in a database (SCHOOL-DB) using the JsonPowerDB API. This form is built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, and integrates with JsonPowerDB to interact with the backend database. The form captures the following student details:

Roll No (Primary Key)
Full Name
Class
Birth Date
Address
Enrollment Date
The project allows for adding new student records, updating existing student data, and validating the input fields before saving or updating the records.
